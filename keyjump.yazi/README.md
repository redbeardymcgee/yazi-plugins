# keyjump.yazi

[upstream](https://gitee.com/DreamMaoMao/keyjump.yazi)

A Yazi plugin that allows jumping to a line by typing a hint character, much
like hop.nvim

> [!NOTE]
> The plug-in has been converted to asynchronous plug-in, so if you
> configured the `--sync` parameter before, please remove this parameter

## Global mode

In global mode, you can jump to everywhere; not only the current pane.
You also can use "Space" key to toggle item selection.

![Global Mode Example](https://github.com/DreamMaoMao/keyjump.yazi/assets/30348075/0a7a44cd-a91b-4377-9787-f4babb0303bf)

## Keep mode

In keep mode, when selecting a directory, it will auto enter and remain in
keyjump mode.

[Keep Mode Example](https://github.com/DreamMaoMao/keyjump.yazi/assets/30348075/dd998a34-49b0-481d-b032-d9849a89ba48)

## Normal mode

In normal mode, when selecting an item, it will leave keyjump mode.

[Normal Mode Example](https://github.com/DreamMaoMao/keyjump/assets/30348075/6ba722ce-8b55-4c80-ac81-b6b7ade74491)

## Select mode

In select mode, you can use the `Space` key to select/unselect item.

## Usage

Set a shortcut key to toggle keyjump mode in `~/.config/yazi/keymap.toml`. For
example, to set `i` to toggle keyjump mode:

```toml
[[manager.prepend_keymap]]
on   = [ "i" ]
run  = "plugin keyjump --args=keep"
desc = "Keyjump (Keep mode)"
```

```toml
[[manager.prepend_keymap]]
on   = [ "i" ]
run  = "plugin keyjump"
desc = "Keyjump (Normal mode)"
```

```toml
[[manager.prepend_keymap]]
on   = [ "i" ]
run  = "plugin keyjump --args=select"
desc = "Keyjump (Select mode)"
```

```toml
[[manager.prepend_keymap]]
on   = [ "i" ]
run  = "plugin keyjump --args=global"
desc = "Keyjump (Global mode)"
```

```toml
[[manager.prepend_keymap]]
on   = [ "i" ]
run  = "plugin keyjump --args='global once'"
desc = "Keyjump (once Global mode)"
```

## Configuration (~/.config/yazi/init.lua)

require("keyjump"):setup {
  icon_fg = "#fda1a1",
}
