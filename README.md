# DreamMaoMao's yazi plugins

## Goal

This is a simple mirror for plugins created by DreamMaoMao after the repos were
privated.

This is not intended to be a fork or continuation (for now). Some cleanup of the
README files is likely, to improve the documentation where I may.

I do not have the git history for these projects. If you have a local clone of
these repositories, please submit an issue here and I will consider a different
way to set this repo up to preserve the original commit history better.

### Installing

`ya pack -a redbeardymcgee/yazi-plugins#PLUGIN-NAME` where `PLUGIN-NAME` is
one of the plugins in this repository. Omit the `.yazi` extension.

`ya pack -a redbeardymcgee/yazi-plugins#fg` will install `fg.yazi`.

#### Currently missing

- `bookmarks-persistence.yazi` (missing: README, LICENSE, .gitignore)
- `current-size.yazi`
- `message-custom.yazi`
- `qxdrag`
- `yazi.nvim` (maintained fork: [mikavilpas/yazi.nvim](https://github.com/mikavilpas/yazi.nvim))
